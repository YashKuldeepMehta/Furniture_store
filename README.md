# Furniture_store
This is an e-commerce website for selling home furniture.
As of now I have completed features such as user authentication with sign-up/login,
basic home page, dynamic category's page using query strings, min/max filter, ratings filter
along with search functionality.
After that I developed the cart functonality with options for updating quantity or removing the 
item altogether.
Currently I am working on checkout page functionality and further going ahead I going to add orders
page, options for customers to post complaints and some polsishing of home and about page.
